Hello there adventurers, fitness enthusiasts, inquisitors, and freewheelers! Welcome to a toolbox of adventure stories (“freewheel”) and the lessons learned (“root”)!

<!-- ### More Information -->

My name is Cherie. I am a personal trainer and copywriter living in Philadelphia. I love burritos, I get chest freezes instead of brain freezes, and I enjoy watching people trip. BUT, more relevantly, I LOVE adventures! To me, “adventure” is leaping into a new experience as though hesitation was never a thing, challenging your body, mind, and/or grit. BUT, this lack of hesitation often translates to doing “preparatory” research afterwards (oops!). SO, in an attempt to keep history from repeating itself (since I’ve learned the same lessons a few times already, like hydration is important as is route review), I’m putting my adventures and research in one place. I hope you (and I) will not only learn from my sometimes obvious mistakes but will be inspired to do some more exploring, questioning, and plunging of your own!
